edited


This prototype serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the feasibility of implementing a new electronic voting system in a real-world environment. 
In addition, the prototype provided valuable insight into the technical challenges and potential benefits of such a system. 
This contribution is a fundamental step towards the digitization of democracy in Kazakhstan 
and represents a tangible starting point for further research and development in blockchain-based e-voting.

To run the project files, you should have installed the Python 3.9 interpreter with pycryptodome package.
Run Mining and Client on 2 different localhosts.
